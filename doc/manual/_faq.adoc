== Contribution

=== I found a bug, what shall I do?

If you find a bug, don't hesitate to open an issue on the GitHub project page.
I'll try to help you as soon as possible.

Feedback is always appreciated.
So open an issue on the GitHub project and describe your ideas.

== Features

=== Why are passphrases not supported for policy projects?

One of the main intention of policy projects is shareability.
Policy projects are also environment independent.
The _real_ configuration, including credentials and keys, is done during the deployment.
So it is feasible to have policy projects without any secret or critical information.

It's a tradeoff between security and usability.
As a developer you have to remember not to store any secret information in a policy project.

=== Why are references not supported for environmentalization?

Environmentalized fields containing a reference to an entity (e.g. reference to a certificate or policy), store the reference as a path to the linked entity.
Getting the path and formatting the XML reference is very difficult and error prone.

Therefore, it is not yet planned to support references.

Please open an issue on GitHub if this is a show stopper for you.
I'll try to find a solution.

=== How to work with certificates?

Always use an alias describing the purpose of the certificate.
If the same certificate is used for multiple purposes, add the certificate multiple times.

Don't use the common name of a certificate as an alias.
Otherwise, for environment specific certificates, there will be a mismatch between the CN in the alias and the CN in the replaced certificate.

NOTE: Remember, environmentalized references are not supported.
So, for a environmentalized field, the link to the certificate (by alias) can't be changed.

== Documentation

=== What about the `.adoc` extension?

The documentation is written in Asciidoc.
So we use the extension `.adoc` for documentation files.

=== How can I read the documentation of the cloned repository in a nice format?

There is an _Asciidoctor.js_ extension for Chrome to view Asciidoc files in a beautiful format.

=== How do I get the documentation in PDF format?

link:https://asciidoctor.org/[Asciidoctor] provides some tools to render Asciidoc sources into various output formats.
link:https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-pdf[Asciidoctor PDF] can be used to convert the documentation into a well layouted PDF document.
Follow the instructions on the the home page to install the tool.

To generate the PDF execute the following command in the root project folder:

  $ asciidoctor-pdf -a pdf-themesdir=doc/pdf-themes -a pdf-theme=axway doc/manual/user-guide.adoc -d book -o user-guide.pdf
